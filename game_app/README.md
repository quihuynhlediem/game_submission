# Prompt Craft â€” Mini Game (Demo)

Minimal Vite + React + Tailwind project demonstrating a simple educational game concept for prompt engineering.

Setup (macOS zsh):

1. Install Node.js (16+). Recommended via nvm:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.4/install.sh | bash
# then in same terminal:
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
source "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
nvm install --lts
```

2. From this folder run:

```bash
cd /Users/Admin/Documents/GitHub Repositories/game_submission/game_app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

Notes:

- This project includes small, local shadcn-style components (Button, Card). It does not depend on the official shadcn generator.
- If you don't want TypeScript, change files to .jsx and update package.json accordingly.
