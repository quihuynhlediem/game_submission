# Concept Prompts used during Brainstorming
## Prompt 1: Ideas
Act as a game developer. Your task is to generate 4 distinct, creative game ideas that.

Context:
- The game's theme must highlight a pressing social challenge in both Vietnam and Australia.
- The final game should be fun, educational, and impactful.
- Format the output as a list. For each of the 4 concepts, provide:
  - Concept Title
  - Social Challenge
  - Core Game Mechanic (1-2 sentences)
  - Educational Angle (How it teaches the player about the issue).

## Prompt 2: Concepts
Let's pivot our focus. Your new task is to design a single, detailed game concept that instructs people on how to create better prompts for LLMs. Also, suggest some potential knowledge base for this game as the stub content.

Context:
- The game's social challenge is now "AI Literacy and Prompt Engineering."
- The primary interaction should be simple, like point-and-click or drag-and-drop, suitable for a chat-like interface.
- Format your response to include the following sections:
  - Gameplay Loop (describe how a player would play a single level)
  - Required Screens (e.g., Menu, Play)
  - Example Level (describe a specific puzzle the player would solve)

## Prompt 3: Mechanics
Act as an educational game designer. Your task is to propose 3 different game formats/mechanics specifically designed to teach prompt engineering to developers.

Core Context & Theme:
- Target Audience: Web and mobile app developers.
- Central Message: An efficient prompt is not just about productivity. It also has a positive impact on cost (fewer API calls), asset quality (better code), and the environment (less energy). The game mechanics must reflect this.
- Format the output as a list of 3 game formats. For each format:
  - Format Name (e.g., "Puzzle," "Simulation")
  - Core Mechanic
  - How It Teaches Efficiency (explain how the mechanics for cost, assets, and environment are shown to the player)

## Prompt 3: Realistic Mapping
I am designing an educational game for developers about prompt engineering. I want to make the cost calculation a realistic

Explain how cost is calculated for an LLM prompt. Break it down clearly, covering the concepts of:
- Tokens (and the word/character rule of thumb).
- The difference between Input Tokens and Output Tokens.
- Why output tokens are typically more expensive.
